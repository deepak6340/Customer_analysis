# Customer_analysis
hey! i have created a Data Analysis project showcasing my skills on Python,Numpy,SQL,Power Bi.
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading a dataset in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The objective is to clean, analyze, and visualize data to generate meaningful insights for decision-making.

The project covers:

Data loading using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and preparation

SQL-based analysis using MySQL

Data visualization using Power BI

📁 Dataset

Source: (Add dataset source here – Kaggle / CSV / internal data)

Format: CSV

Description:
The dataset contains structured data used to perform analysis, identify trends, and create dashboards.
(Briefly mention what type of data it is: sales, customers, finance, etc.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data processing and analysis

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

MySQL – Running analytical SQL queries

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified schema, data types, and basic structure.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distribution and summary statistics.

Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Visualized key variables using charts.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.

Removed duplicates.

Corrected data types.

Standardized column names and formats.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.

Ran SQL queries for:

Aggregations

Filtering

Joins

Business-level insights

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.

Built interactive dashboards with:

KPIs

Charts and tables

Filters and slicers

📊 Dashboards

The Power BI dashboard provides:

High-level KPIs

Trend analysis

Comparative insights

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

(Add screenshots of the dashboard here if available)

📈 Results & Insights

Identified key trends and performance metrics.

Highlighted important business insights through visualizations.

Enabled data-driven decision-making using an interactive dashboard.
